# Anomaly-Detection-in-Dynamic-Graphs-Using-Deep-Machine-Learning-Methods
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have emerged as cutting-edge technologies with wide-ranging applications in daily life. One area of application is dynamic graphs, which represent relationships between entities at different points in time with the goal of anomaly detection—that is, identifying unusual patterns that deviate from expected norms. This work explores the use of the DyGED model and its variations (DyGED-CT, DyGED-NL, DyGED-NA) for event detection in dynamic graphs, leveraging both temporal and structural features. Initially, the models are analyzed and run on random graphs, and then evaluated on specific datasets sourced from the recommended databases of the authors, as well as our own datasets generated via the RDyn library. The analysis of the results shows that the DyGED model consistently ranks among the top two models in each case compared to its variations. While the DyGED variations demonstrate strong performance, the core DyGED model stands out for its stability and reliable superiority over the other versions
# Training Files and Data for DyGED Models and Variants (DyGED-CT, DyGED-NL, DyGED-NA)
To access the necessary files, including the NYC Cab and Twitter Weather datasets, as well as the models.py and layers.py files, you can visit the DyGED Repository. There, you will find the original implementation of the DyGED model and its variations (DyGED-CT, DyGED-NL, DyGED-NA) used in this work.
